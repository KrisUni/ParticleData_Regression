Machine Learning Regression on Particle Data

Description:
This project analyzes particle physics data from CERN using feature selection and linear regression. It:

-Loads and processes HDF5 datasets 

-Selects key features using SelectKBest

-Trains a linear regression model

-Evaluates model performance with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ²
